     * Write->Flush dependency tracking.
     *
     * A Crucible downstairs applies jobs from an internal work queue and is
     * free to reorder independent jobs; the dependency list is what forces
     * ordering.  ZFS issues many concurrent Writes from its z_wr threads and
     * then a single Flush to close the txg.  Each Flush must depend on every
     * Write submitted since the previous Flush, otherwise a downstairs that
     * is lagging (e.g. the 3rd replica past 2/3 quorum) may apply the Flush
     * before an outstanding Write -- the Write then lands after the flush
     * boundary on that replica and is not durable on crash, which presents as
     * a wedged txg_wait_synced or silent divergence between replicas.
     *
     * A new Write in turn depends on the most recent Flush so a write issued
     * after a flush is ordered after it, matching the upstream upstairs.
     *
     * We deliberately do NOT add Write->Write dependencies for overlapping
     * block ranges (which the full upstream upstairs does).  ZFS is copy-on-
     * write: it never issues two concurrent writes to the same block within a
     * txg -- each logical block gets a freshly allocated DVA -- so independent
     * Writes are genuinely order-insensitive and only the Flush barrier needs
     * ordering.  The few in-place rewrites (labels, uberblock array) are
     * issued at txg-sync time, serialized behind the data Writes by this same
     * Flush barrier.
     *
     * dep_mtx_ serializes "allocate id + record" against "snapshot + reset"
     * so the snapshot taken by a Flush is exactly the set of Writes ZFS
     * ordered before it.
