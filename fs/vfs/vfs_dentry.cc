 * LOCK ORDERING RULE (whole VFS):

 *     vnode lock (vn_lock)  ->  dentry_hash_lock
 *
 * and NEVER the reverse.  namei() establishes this direction: it holds
 * vn_lock(dvp) across dentry_lookup()/dentry_alloc() (vfs_lookup.cc), both of
 * which take dentry_hash_lock inside.  Therefore no code may call anything
 * that takes a vnode lock while holding dentry_hash_lock.
 *
 * drele() used to violate exactly that: it took dentry_hash_lock and then
 * called vn_del_name(), which does vn_lock() internally.  A namei() on one
 * thread (vn_lock held, waiting for dentry_hash_lock) against a drele() on
 * another (dentry_hash_lock held, waiting for vn_lock) is an AB-BA deadlock
 * with nothing left runnable -- observed as all vCPUs halted in do_idle with
 * an empty wakeup mask and >1000 threads parked, while memory was plentiful.
 *
 * dentry_hash_lock is a leaf lock now.  Keep it that way: do not call out to
 * vnode code, and do not allocate, while holding it.
